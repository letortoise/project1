# Project 1


Project 1 is an application that enables users to review books. Users may search
for books in the database by title, author or ISBN. They may then leave a review,
read reviews from other Project 1 users, and even see how the book is rated on
Goodreads. Finally, Project 1 provides an API that allows users to access basic information
about a book (title, author, year of publication) by providing an ISBN, as well as access
information about that book's reviews (number of reviews, average score) on Project 1.
